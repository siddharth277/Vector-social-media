- `/api/posts` - feed, single post, create, edit, like, delete, top posts
- `/api/comments` - comment create, list, delete
- `/api/notifications` - fetch, mark read, delete one, bulk delete, clear all
- `/api/conversation` - start and fetch conversations
- `/api/messages` - fetch, send, read, delete messages
- `/api/contact` - contact form submission
- `/api/reports` - report-related flows

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Frontend: `client/.env.local`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```

Backend: `server/.env`

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
EMAIL=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password_or_app_password
```

### 3. Setting up Third-Party Services

To fill out the environment variables above, you will need to set up the following free services:

- **MongoDB**: Create a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). Click "Connect", choose "Drivers", and copy the connection string. Replace `<password>` with your database user password.
- **Cloudinary**: Sign up at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Your `Cloud Name`, `API Key`, and `API Secret` will be immediately visible on your Programmable Media Dashboard.
- **Google OAuth**: Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create a new project, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**, click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID" (Web application). Add `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback` to the Authorized redirect URIs. Copy the Client ID and Secret.
- **Nodemailer (Gmail)**: To send emails, you must use a Google App Password. Go to your Google Account -> **Security** -> **2-Step Verification** -> **App passwords**. Generate a new password and use that 16-character string as your `EMAIL_PASS`.

### 4. Start the apps

Start a local Redis instance (required for Socket.IO messaging):

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

Backend:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

By default:

- frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`

## Scripts

### Client

- `npm run dev` - start the Next.js dev server
- `npm run build` - create a production build
- `npm run start` - run the production build
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint
- `npm run test` - run Vitest

### Server

- `npm run dev` - start the API with Nodemon
- `npm run start` - start the API with Node
- `npm run test` - run Jest tests
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint

## Testing

The repository now includes both client and server test setup:

- client tests use `Vitest`
- server tests use `Jest` + `Supertest` + `mongodb-memory-server`

Examples:

```bash
cd client
npm run test
```

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

## Notes

- The app uses cookie-based auth, so frontend API requests send credentials.
- Socket.IO registration is authenticated through the server-side handshake.
- Some routes use optional auth so they can return public data for guests and personalized data for logged-in users.
- The codebase is under active development and still has room for additional tests, cleanup, and UX refinements.

## Contributing

Good first contributions include:

- adding missing tests
- fixing loading or empty states
- tightening validation and error messages
- improving documentation
- cleaning duplicated logic across routes and components
